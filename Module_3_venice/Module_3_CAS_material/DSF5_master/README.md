It contains the presentations, notebooks and additional data/files  needed for the exercises.

The learning contents and Learning outcomes:

* Overview of machine learning pipelines and their implementation with scikit-learn
* Regression and Classification: linear models and logistic regression
* Decision trees & random forest models
* Clustering with K-means and Gaussian mixtures
* Principal component analysis (PCA) and non-linear embeddings (t-SNE and UMAP)
* Artificial Neural networks as general fitters, fully connected nets used to classify the fashion-MNIST dataset
* Scikit-learn and clustering maps, Q&A
